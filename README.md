# Sandesh JS SDK

Sandesh is an on-chain messaging protocol that allows Dapp builders to easily integrate on-chain messaging into their dapps.

You don't need to worry about writing smart contracts, storing data on IPFS or resolving domains. We got you covered for all these out of the box.

In addition, it's fully configurable SDK to add specific needs. 

> We also support Dapp specific chats, so experience doesn't get distrubed for your users.


## Installation

To install the SDK simply type:
```ts
  yarn add sandesh
```
or 
```ts
  npm i -s sandesh
```
